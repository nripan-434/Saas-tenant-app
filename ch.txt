Ares – Multi-Tenant B2B SaaS Productivity Platform with AI Orchestration

Ares is an advanced full-stack B2B SaaS productivity platform engineered to address one of the core challenges in modern SaaS systems: secure logical data isolation in a shared NoSQL environment. The platform enables multiple independent organizations to coexist on a single infrastructure while ensuring strict tenant-level separation, performance efficiency, and controlled AI resource usage.

The system is built using the MERN stack, with a middleware-driven tenant isolation layer, real-time collaboration via Socket.io, and an AI orchestration module that enforces per-organization quotas. The architecture emphasizes security-first design, scalable MongoDB data modeling, and clean separation of concerns suitable for enterprise-grade SaaS applications.

our Flow — Validated (with corrections)
✅ 1. Organization Admin registers

Correct.

This is the only public registration

Creates the first admin user

✅ 2. Organization is created automatically

Correct.

Org is created transactionally with admin

If org creation fails → user must not exist

✅ 3. Admin invites users by email

Correct.

Admin does not create users

Admin creates invites

✅ 4. User receives email invite

Correct.

Email contains:

signed invite token

org context

role

✅ 5. User sets password → account created

Mostly correct, but important detail:

User does not choose org

User does not choose role

User is created only after invite verification

This is not “registration”, it is invite acceptance

✅ 6. Admin creates Projects

Correct.

Projects belong to organization

Only certain roles can create projects

✅ 7. Admin assigns Tasks to Users

Correct.

Task must validate:

user belongs to same org

user has assignable role

✅ 8. Users update task status

Correct.

Only:

assigned user

or privileged roles

Backend must enforce this.

✅ 9. Real-time updates via Socket.io

Correct.

Scoped by:

organization

project

Never global

✅ 10. AI summaries + subscription limits

Correct — but this is advanced tier, not core.

Requires:

usage tracking

org-level quotas

plan enforcement middleware
